**Problem:** As a product data scientist at instagram, how would you measure the success of instagram TV as a product?

**Solution**
In determining success of IGTV as a product, I would evaluate and analyze key performance indicators such as engagements, growth, retention rate, user satisfaction and revenue generation.

**Data collection**
Hypothetical data may be collected and analyzed. The important data are as follows;

**1. Engagements**
By closely following up on the number of likes, views, comments and shares we would get a close insight of the progress of IGTV. An increase in engagements as time goes by shows a remarkable increase in users and time spent on the product.

**2. Growth**
The number of new users could be used to show how influential IGTV is and how widespread it is becoming. Thus the number of user increase over a given period of time is crucial.

**3. Retention Rate**
This shows how many users are leaving and how many are being retained by the product over time. The higher the retention rate over time will indicate a great achievement and shows that the users are actually satisfied with the product and choose to remain with it.

**4. User satisfaction**
Collecting information from users on how they find the product useful or how they have rated the product is a great way of measuring the success of the product. An average increase in positive feedback from users shows that the product is actually doing what it was meant to do.

**5. Revenue generation**
The amount of revenue generated from ads is a great marker of success, if the revenues are high then this shows that users are actually using the product.

**Data analysis and visualization**
Calculations of means shows the average distribution of data of interest. This can be done by use of python.
similarly, graphs such as bar graphs and histograms may be drawn as well as pie charts in order to communicate visually which is less wordy and easier to understand. This is possible by use of matlib.
